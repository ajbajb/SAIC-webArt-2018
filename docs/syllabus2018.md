### Course Description
Professional Practice: Web Art is a course that combines creative and practical knowledge related to web site development. Launched in 1989 as a remote file sharing system for scientists, the World Wide Web is nearly thirty years old. Today, the web functions as an exhibition space, a communications hub as well as a nexus for creative expression. Students in the Web Art class will learn the Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML), which is the basis of WWW authoring. Potential overall format and conceptual frameworks for developing a media-rich web site will be investigated, and ways of subverting the traditional web page format in order to create unique approaches to the dynamics of the web will be explored. Course activities include technical tutorials, preparation of a CV, writing of a project statement, and the creation of a web site.

### Student Learning Goals
* Implement a well-planned creative project, applying professional skills relevant to your artistic, creative, and/or scholarly practice.
* Present a professional body of work in an online context, demonstrating a critical awareness of audience and selection of work.
* Create connections and linkages with relevant practitioners, organizations, and institutions in students’ field(s) of interest, with an attention to identifying key figures as well as situating their own work within these fields.
* Demonstrate the ability to think, speak, and write clearly and effectively with regard to the creative and/or scholarly practice.

### Additional Course Description/Goals
* Understand and critique the structure of the internet and its networks.
* Think nonlinearly through hypermedia and code.
* Creatively deploy HTML, CSS and Javascript to create art on/for the wen and with the web.
* Build a critical framework for discussing your work in the wider context of internet art, net.art.
