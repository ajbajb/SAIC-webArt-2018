Your artist research project-

__Assignment__
1. select one work from the exhibition that you found interesting, compelling, successful, or perhaps even a downright failure.
2. research the artist and the particular work. What was the artist attempting to address?  What was the context in which it was made, for example what were the social, economic, geographical situations in which this work was made in?
3. How does this work fit into the sphere of 'internet culture'?
4. Why is this work and/or artist interesting to you? Why do you think it is successful or not?
5. Is this work typical of the artists other work?
- You are allowed to work in pairs, but then you will have to go _extra_ deep with your research.
- You are also allowed to talk about other aspects of the piece and/or artist you find interesting.
Prepare a 5 minute presentation in which you discuss these topics. Perhaps render the presentation into a webpage? Use images.
- __Due Sept 13__
I understand that it might be hard to find information on a particular work or artist. Try the best you can! Be creative! You do not necessarily have to answer all the topic points.
