## Homework for Thursday __(9.20.2018)__

### Sketch
Create a "data-diary" sketch using your HTML knowledge. Take some aspect of your self or your habits and translate it into HTML. It could involve:
- A visual representation of your searching/browsing history
- A sequence of YouTube videos following your chain of thought
- A tapestry of meaningful street view locations
- Logs of conversations/tweets/texts/IMs/etc.
- Snapshots of your daily IRL/desktop/browser habits

### Technical Constraints
The site should be composed of (at minimum) two (2) pages:
1. A page (or pages) with your data-diary
2. An "about" page that has __your name, sketch title, at least a couple of sentences explaining your process, and perhaps a couple of sentences about yourself.__

There needs to be a navigation menu on your pages that allows visitors to navigate between your various pages.
### Turning In the Assignment
Option 1: zip the folder and DM it to me on Slack. <br/>
Option 2 (Bonus!): Upload it to GitHub pages and DM me a link in Slack.
